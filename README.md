Valid Parentheses  
Solved  
Easy  

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']',  
determine if the input string is valid.  

An input string is valid if:  

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.  
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.  
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.  
 

**Example 1:**  

Input: s = "()"  
Output: True  

**Example 2:**  

Input: s = "()[]{}"  
Output: True  

**Example 3:**  

Input: s = "(]"  
Output: False  
 

Constraints:  

1 <= s.length <= 104  
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.
